## Hello, nice to have you here.

I am a private lecturer (German: Privatdozent) at the [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de), Germany. 
I am working at the [Institute of Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.thi.uni-hannover.de), where I also did my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Computer Science as well as my PhD and Habilitation.

## Research Interests (alphabetical order)

- **Argumentation:** abstract as well as logic-based
- **Artificial Intelligence:** logical foundations
- **Complexity Theory:** problem complexity, parameterised complexity
- **Enumeration:** parameterised enumeration, enumeration complexity
- **Logic in Computer Science:** non-classical, non-monotonic, team, temporal, hybrid, modal, default, and autoepistemic logic
